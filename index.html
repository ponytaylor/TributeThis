                <p>When I was young, there weren't a lot of science fiction books in the library. And hardly any of them were written by female authors. When I found a book by Zenna Henderson, it changed the way I thought about stories and science fiction. Her stories were about women and children, who were often left out of the other books, or made into characters that weren't like anyone I knew. The wonder and fears felt by her characters seemed so real to me, and captured my imagination for life.</p>
